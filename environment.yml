  - scipy                    # Occasional advanced math/spatial algorithms
  - networkx                 # The gold standard for Graph Theory (shortest path, cliques)
  - sympy                    # Symbolic math (solving equations without brute force)
  - z3-solver                # The "Secret Weapon" for constraint satisfaction problems
  - more-itertools           # Extends standard library with chunking, sliding windows, etc.
  - parse                    # Like f-strings in reverse; easier than Regex for parsing inputs
